Reinhardt's design stems from the playable Juggernaut class in the cancelled Project Titan. During the initial pitch for the project that would become Overwatch, the Juggernaut was envisioned as wielding a flamethrower and a flail, and used the Charge ability; a flamethrower was also considered for Roadhog's primary weapon early in the development for Overwatch. Early ideation for Reinhardt's design in Overwatch involved several different versions of humanoid robots, eventually progressing into a robotic hero from Numbani named Wildebeest, outfitted with red body armor incorporating tribal motifs and wielding a shield and a mace or flail. An early version of Wildebeest appeared in several early promotional illustrations depicting potential hero lineups for the game, and was also seen as one of the former Overwatch agents contacted by Winston in the Recall animated short. Elements of this hero concept would later serve as a basis for Orisa, while the flail and shield combination would eventually be incorporated into the hero design for Brigitte. One of Wildebeest's unused designs shares its color scheme with the OR15 defense robots, while another strongly resembles Doomfist's Spirit skin. Arnold Tsang revealed that Reinhardt's new design for Overwatch 2 marks the ninth iteration of his armor, progressing from the eighth in the original game. This continues a legacy that dates back to Arnold's concept art for the Juggernaut class in Project Titan, which went through seven iterations before the game was cancelled. Reinhardt's new design incorporates some elements from those scrapped Juggernaut concepts, and features a more technologically advanced appearance to show that Winston helped upgrade it after Reinhardt rejoined the team.
